          <h2>Topic Summary</h2>

          For this project, we aim to provide a place where individuals with mental illnesses could find solace. Sometimes, especially for college students, life can get really overwhelming. There are a variety of mental illnesses in the world, but we wanted to tailor this particular website to those with anxiety and depression. We decided on these particular illnesses because it is something that a majority of college students often experience in the day to day life of courses, responsibilities, and deadlines. As each generation becomes more and more competitive, it is harder to find a time where students can unwind and have fun. “It is a natural and important emotion, signaling through stirrings of worry, fearfulness, and alarm that danger or a sudden, threatening change is near. Yet sometimes anxiety becomes an exaggerated, unhealthy response.” It seems that everyone is worried about their future and school has become an unhealthy responsibility amongst the rest of the gifts that life gives us in our prime. With this website; students, millenials, and other adolescents can come to this website and use it according to their needs. Depending on their levels of anxiety and depression, they are able to log that, and then record themselves using speech recognition- similar to a journal. This acts as an alternative to those who are uncomfortable sharing their problems with a stranger like a therapist, or bomboarding their friends and family with things they may not understand. The site will not only act as a journal, but users can also choose to sign up for daily uplifting reminders in order to calm them or help them each day.

          <h2>Target Audience</h2>

          The target audience, as explained in the topic summary, are college students. This website would not cost money, therefore students will not have to worry about financial burden. With the current scarcity of on-campus psychologists and counsellors, this site can also pose as a solution to the issue. For the education level, it does not matter as long as he or she understands how to use the internet. Students will be able to have access to their profile 24/7 as responsive design gives way to mobile device usage. Individuals using this website want to get better, or at least have an outlet where they are comfortable enough to share. In some instances, in the feeling of anxiety and depression, it may seem like they are alone in their fears and worries. This can serve as a platform where students can express how they are feeling and when they are feeling it. This will help them track when and why they were anxious and depressed, and then later on be able to see how the outcome was and where they can improve for the next episode or time of anxiety and depression.

          <h2>Goals of the Project</h2>

          The goal of this project is to tailor specifically to college students because, as college students, we are often in the state of anxiety and depression. This may be caused by many aspects of the college life, but some of them may include the pressure grades, social situations, time management, success, and other things that may be hindering the already busy life of a student. We hope to bring a platform in which students could find solace and comfort instead of keeping it to themselves and getting worse. This could act as a somewhat self therapy.

          Also, currently there is an unfortunate scarcity in the number of psychologists and counsellors on campus. We hope the site can help ease the current situation. Mental health is a serious issue and in a rigorous and competitive environment like UC Davis, such scarcity cannot be afforded.

          <h2>Communication Strategy</h2>

          The communications strategy we plan to use is through a journal type form, with a playlist available for soothing, and a graph that can be implemented for progress reports. User will also have access to the option of opting for daily reminders or quotes that are positive and uplifting.

          In the future, we hope to add the feature of having psychologists remotely monitor the user if the user wants to. This way, direct feedback can be given at any time and place without needing to go, wait and meet the psychologist.

          <h2>Goals for Overall Look and Feel</h2>

          For the overall look and feel of the website, we plan to use cool, calming colors that act as a calming agent as well. Cooler, calmer, and pastel colors are more calming than brighter warmer colors. Colors like blue, are helpful in calming someone down, and reducing the feeling of nervousness, nauseousness, fear, and other emotions. Navigation will also be made as simple as possible so that it won’t stress the user out further.
