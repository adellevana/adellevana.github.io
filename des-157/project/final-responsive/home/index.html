            <h1>About</h1>
              <p>
                We aim to provide a place where individuals with mental illnesses can find Solace. Sometimes, especially for college students, life can get really overwhelming. There are a variety of Mental Health issues in the world, but we wanted to tailor this particular website to those with Anxiety and Depression. We decided on these particular issues because it is something that a majority of college students often experience in the day to day life of courses, responsibilities, and deadlines. As each generation becomes more and more competitive, it is harder to find a time where students can unwind and have their peace of mind.<br>
              </p>
              <p><br>
                It is a natural and important emotion, signaling through stirrings of worry, fearfulness, and alarm that danger or a sudden, threatening change is near. Yet sometimes Anxiety becomes an exaggerated, unhealthy response. It seems that everyone is worried about their future and school has become an unhealthy responsibility amongst the rest of the gifts that life gives us in our prime. With this website; students, millenials, and other adolescents can come to this website and use it according to their needs. Depending on their levels of Anxiety and Depression, they are able to log that, and then record themselves using speech recognition- similar to a journal. This acts as an alternative to those who are uncomfortable sharing their problems with a stranger like a therapist, or bomboarding their friends and family with things they may not understand. The site will not only act as a journal, but users can also track their progress and look up daily uplifting reminders in order to calm them or help them each day.
